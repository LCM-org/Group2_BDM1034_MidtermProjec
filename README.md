Subject: 2023W-T2 BDM 1034 - Application Design for Big Data Group Number: Group 2

In this project we took the dataset of weather observations from  Australia and we have learned and used LogisticRegression and XGBoost to depict weather the model is perfect or not. We used boxplot concept to remove the outliers but did not use the actual formula for IQR and L-H filters due to a huge chunck of data getting removed. The claculations are been done through an online tool and post that model was trained.
